# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.14] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- `linearctl update check` compares the installed version with the latest GitHub release and recommends the update command for how linearctl was installed (package manager, npm, raw binary or checkout) instead of replacing the binary. The distribution and update policy is in `docs/distribution.md`.

## [0.8.12] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Make the temporary macOS signing keychain discoverable to codesign's private-key lookup, restoring the original keychain search list on every exit path. The v0.8.11 release was blocked before publication by this lookup failure.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- Require Developer ID signing and Apple notarization for both macOS release binaries, with fresh native-runner verification before publication. First launch requires online ticket retrieval; standalone binaries cannot carry stapled tickets.
- Share the pinned, verified build pipeline between CI and releases, and gate publication on validation of the exact tagged commit.

### Fixed

- Preserve completed upload/project resources, structured errors, and meaningful exit codes when composite workflows fail; report skipped steps and provide recovery guidance in human and both JSON modes.
- Verify staged Unix installer downloads before atomically replacing an existing installation, and preserve macOS quarantine instead of bypassing Gatekeeper.
- Stream file transfers with cancellation and atomic downloads.
- Preserve partial pagination results and resume context when transport requests fail.
- Honor JSON envelopes in remaining top-level CLI error paths.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Added issue due-date reads, exact list filtering, create/update support, and bulk updates through `--due-date`.
- Added `--parent` and `--group` to create child labels and label groups.
- Added install path, presence, and freshness information to `skills list`.
- Added non-interactive OAuth client-credentials login with secure env/stdin client-secret input.

### Changed

- Made `issue update` and `issue bulk-update` `--label` additive so existing labels are preserved.
- Added a consistent `none` sentinel for clearing nullable issue assignee, cycle, project, milestone, parent, and due-date fields.

### Fixed

- Added unassigned issue filtering and comma-separated multi-state filters to `issue list`.
- Made Unix credential permission errors report the resolved file path, actual mode, expected policy, and `chmod 600` remediation.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Packaged the Windows x64 release as `linearctl-windows-x64.zip` with `linearctl.exe` at the archive root. The PowerShell installer remains compatible with the uncompressed v0.8.8 asset.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added Windows x64 CI and release binaries, a checksum-verifying PowerShell installer, and native Windows installation documentation.
- Added Windows credential protection using non-inheriting, current-user-only ACLs while preserving strict `0600` enforcement on Unix.

### Changed

- Made asset copying and cross-process tests portable across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Hardened artifact installation, authenticated network requests, configuration serialization, and release workflows.
- Corrected schema drift detection, command validation, identifier resolution, attachment/comment behavior, and credential edge cases.
- Improved bulk operation and workspace listing performance.
- Serialized OAuth refresh, login, and logout credential updates across processes without allowing failed config rollback to overwrite newer credentials.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added curated `relation list`, `relation create`, and `relation delete` commands for issue relations, including duplicate, blocking, related, and similar links.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- `comment list` now reads the selected issue's comments connection, avoiding false empty results from the workspace-wide comments filter.
- `comment list <issue>` now accepts a positional issue identifier as an alternative to `--issue <id>`.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Issue JSON now includes `projectMilestone` so reads can verify milestone writes.
- Comments now accept `--body-file <path|->` anywhere `--body <text>` is accepted.
- `project list --all` uses 50-item pages by default to stay under Linear's query-complexity limit while preserving stable JSON fields.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Quickstart and command docs now match the current JSONL pagination and workflow-state command contracts.
- OAuth setup docs and login output call out the exact redirect URI that must be registered in Linear.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Inline GraphQL errors now use the same taxonomy as caught transport errors, so missing referenced issues consistently report `category: "not-found"` and exit code 4 across `issue get`, `issue update`, `issue delete`, and bulk operations.
- `issue get` / `issue view` JSON now includes `trashed` and `archivedAt`, and human output marks trashed/archived issues so delete-then-verify workflows can distinguish soft-deleted issues from live ones.
- `comment list --issue <identifier>` now reports not-found when a human-readable parent issue identifier does not resolve, instead of silently returning an empty list.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Linear `Entity not found` GraphQL failures now map to the not-found category and exit code 4, including bulk per-item failures.
- Leading `--version` and `--metadata curated --json` now short-circuit before every registered command by composing global option groups across the registry.
- `issue list --search` once again applies the profile default team, while `issue search` remains workspace-wide unless `--team` is passed.
- Cross-host file upload redirects preserve content negotiation headers such as `Content-Type` while still dropping authorization and signed storage headers.
- Generated `api` commands only treat retry option `RangeError`s as validation errors; execution-time `RangeError`s now remain general failures.
- `schema pull` and `schema check` responses missing introspection schema data are general failures rather than validation errors.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `issue search <text>` without `--team` searches the whole workspace again, even when the active profile has a default team. Pass `--team` to scope full-text search explicitly.
- **Breaking:** Bulk operation failure envelopes now preserve mapped per-item error categories, and the overall exit code is derived by priority: auth, rate-limit, not-found, then general.
- File upload and download now follow cross-host redirects after dropping Linear authorization and signed upload headers; same-host redirects continue to preserve those headers.
- `issue create --dry-run` resolves friendly names before emitting the dry-run payload, so dry runs validate resolvability without creating issues.

### Fixed

- `--no-retry` and `--max-retries` now reach all curated list pagination paths, not only issue listing.
- Team, user, and label resolution now prefer exact case-sensitive matches before reporting ambiguity; users prefer email matches, and team-scoped labels beat same-named workspace labels under `--team`.
- Leading `--version` and `--metadata curated --json` now early-exit correctly even when command tokens follow them.
- Curated metadata classifies archive/delete semantics consistently, including bulk operations, and reserves `confirmation-required` for commands that actually require confirmation.
- `Retry-After` sleeps are capped at the maximum retry delay and report a stderr notice that the pause came from `Retry-After`.
- `issue search --order-by` / `--order-dir` now errors clearly instead of dropping ordering flags.
- `schema pull` help shows the real default output directory, `<config-dir>/schema`.
- `api`, `gql`, and `schema` validation errors now use the unified envelope-aware emitter when `--json-envelope` is set.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Schema freshness checks now cache failed or aborted attempts for the same 24-hour interval as successful checks, preventing repeated post-command introspection attempts when the advisory network probe times out.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Importing the generated API manifest builder no longer rewrites the tracked `api-commands.json`, removing a parallel test race with commands that import the bundled API manifest.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Friendly name resolution for teams, users, labels, states, and projects is case-insensitive. `issue list --state` now uses workflow state resolution when a team scope is available, and team-scoped label resolution includes workspace labels.
- `cycle delete` now explicitly reports that Linear archives cycles instead of deleting them, including dry-run and JSON output.
- File upload and download requests now use manual redirect handling and reject redirects to a different host before reusing signed upload headers or Linear authorization.
- OAuth token refresh tolerates concurrent credential rotation by re-reading credentials after `invalid_grant`, and token refresh errors no longer include raw response bodies.
- Autopagination defaults to the maximum page size for bounded `--all`/`--max` requests when `--page-size` is omitted.

### Fixed

- `gql --var key=value` preserves leading and trailing whitespace in `value`.
- Project name resolution now uses server-side `containsIgnoreCase` filtering before client-side exact/prefix/substring disambiguation.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added `issue bulk-archive` for the previous bulk archiving behavior.
- Retry is now default-on for GraphQL rate limits, honors HTTP `Retry-After`, and applies to command execution, pagination, and name resolution.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `issue bulk-close` now transitions issues to a completed workflow state, matching `issue close`; use `issue bulk-archive` to archive issues.
- **Breaking:** Bulk operations with any failed item now exit non-zero. `--json-envelope` responses use `ok: false`, populate `errors[]`, include per-item `data.succeeded`/`data.failed`, and set `meta.partial: true` when some items succeeded.
- **Breaking:** `issue list --search` composes with the same filters as `issue list` instead of silently discarding filters.
- **Breaking:** `--metadata curated` now requires `--json`, `--json --jsonl` is rejected, and `--jsonl` requires an explicit `--all` or `--max <n>` bound.

## [0.6.14] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `project create` and `project create-with-issues` now apply `--start-date`, `--target-date`, `--status`/`--state`, `--lead`, and long-form `--content` fields to `ProjectCreateInput`.
- Curated command metadata is now derived from the command registry so agent discovery covers every curated subcommand, including destructive safety annotations.

### Fixed

- Parse-level validation failures now emit failure envelopes when `--json-envelope` is requested.
- Options placed before a command are validated against that command's option set instead of the global catalog.
- Pagination helpers preserve GraphQL transport error typing so list/streaming failures map to the documented error contract.
- Generated `api` commands use the shared command error mapper, including Linear `userPresentableMessage` details.
- Schema freshness checks run after command completion with a timeout, skip help and dry-run paths, and compare against pulled schema metadata when present.
- Schema fingerprints now include type signatures, not just type and field names.

## [0.6.13] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- `--help` on curated subcommands with additional positionals now prints help and exits before command dispatch, preventing discovery commands such as `issue delete <id> --help` from executing.
- CLI subprocess tests now pass explicit temp config and credentials paths so the suite does not read or update the user's Linear config.

## [0.6.12] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `issue update` and `issue bulk-update` now support `--project-milestone <id>` and the `--milestone <id>` alias.
- `project create` and `project update` now support long-form project bodies with `--content <text>` and `--content-file <path|->`.
- Generated `api <resource> <operation> --help` now prints operation usage and input guidance before validating required arguments.

### Fixed

- `issue update` and `project update` missing-identifier usage now lists the full supported flag set.

## [0.6.11] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `issue create`, `issue update`, `project create`, and `project update` now support `--description-file <path>` and `--description-file -` for explicit stdin-sourced descriptions.

### Fixed

- `issue create`, `issue update`, `project create`, and `project update` keep `--description` as a literal flag value and only read stdin when `--description-file -` is provided, avoiding accidental stdin consumption in shell loops.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- `project create --lead` now maps the provided user ID, email, or `"me"` value to `ProjectCreateInput.leadId` so new projects are created with their lead set.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Normal commands now perform a best-effort schema freshness check at most once per day when the bundled schema is older than the configured threshold.
- Added `[schema]` config support for `stale_after_days` and opt-in `auto_update`.
- GraphQL field/type lookup failures now include a hint to run `linearctl schema check`.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- `team members <name>` now resolves team names before fetching members.
- Issue JSON includes parent issue details alongside `estimate`.
- `issue update --project <name>` falls back to workspace-wide project name resolution when team-scoped lookup misses.
- `file upload` includes a `Content-Type` header for the storage PUT request when Linear does not return one.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `cycle archive/delete` and `state archive/delete` provide curated cleanup commands without raw GraphQL.

### Fixed

- Curated issue JSON now includes `estimate`, and `issue update --project` plus `issue bulk-update --state` resolve friendly names consistently.
- `team get/members`, `user get`, `label get`, and `state get` now accept friendly names where Linear supports resolution.
- `cycle list`, `file upload`, and `attachment list --issue` use current Linear GraphQL shapes.
- `project create-with-issues` now defaults missing issue `teamId` values from the command-level `--team`.
- `workspace list` refreshes missing workspace/user metadata from each configured profile.
- Unknown top-level commands now report a clear unknown-command error.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `issue delete <identifier>` and `issue bulk-delete --ids <ids> --yes` provide curated issue deletion without raw GraphQL.
- `gql mutation` now accepts bare mutation selection sets such as `{ issueDelete(...) { success } }` and sends them as mutation operations.

### Fixed

- `issue close --state <name>` now accepts canceled workflow states as terminal states in addition to completed states.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `issue view <identifier>` is now an alias for `issue get <identifier>`.
- `issue search` now accepts the query as a positional argument, and `issue list --search/--query <text>` routes to full-text issue search.
- `project list` now supports `--query`, `--search`, and `--name` for project-name filtering.
- `--limit <n>` is accepted as an alias for `--max <n>` on paginated commands.

### Fixed

- Team-scoped project name resolution now uses Linear's `accessibleTeams` project filter instead of invalid `ProjectFilter.teams`, fixing project lookups and `issue list --project` workflows that previously failed with GraphQL 400 errors.
- `issue list --status <name>` is accepted as an alias for `--state <name>`.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `cycle get` and `cycle current` JSON now include progress and scope metrics from Linear, including `progress`, derived `scopeCount`, `completedScopeCount`, `inProgressScopeCount`, `startedScopeCount`, issue counts, history arrays, and uncompleted issues captured on close.
- `team members <id-or-key>` now includes the member `name` field alongside `displayName`, `email`, and `active`.

### Fixed

- `issue list --assignee <value>` now resolves Linear `displayName` values in addition to `name`, `email`, UUID, and `me`.
- `issue list --state` and `project list --state` now support repeated flags as union filters instead of silently using only the last value.
- `project get <name>` and `issue list --project <name>` now resolve unique prefix or substring project-name matches, with ambiguity errors when multiple projects match.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `project list` JSON milestones now include `progress` and `status`, and human output surfaces progress, health, updated time, description, and milestone summaries for portfolio reviews.
- `project update` now supports `--status <name|type|id>`, `--lead <user-id|email|"me">`, and `--start-date <YYYY-MM-DD>` alongside existing name, description, state alias, and target date updates.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `team members <id-or-key>` lists team members with `id`, `displayName`, `email`, and `active` fields.

### Fixed

- `issue search` now uses Linear's supported `searchIssues` API instead of the deprecated `issueSearch` field.
- Generated `api team-membership` commands include useful membership, user, and team fields by default instead of returning bare IDs.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- `issue create` now accepts `--project-milestone <id>` and `--milestone <id>` to set the project milestone at creation time.

### Fixed

- `project get <name>` now resolves project names through GraphQL variables, including names with special characters such as `&`.
- `issue list --project <name>` now resolves project names before filtering instead of passing names to Linear as IDs.
- `project list --json` keeps machine-readable output on stdout, with regression coverage for clean stderr/stdout separation.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- Generated API commands now handle optional `id` arguments, scalar returns, and payloads without assuming invalid GraphQL field selections
- Retry option normalization is shared and validates programmatic `maxRetries` values before executing GraphQL requests
- Packaged builds now include the bundled schema file for structural schema drift checks
- Vitest no longer discovers copied agent worktree test suites

## [0.5.8] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- Top-level help now shows a grouped overview of curated resources instead of one long flat command list; full curated usage lines moved to `linearctl <resource> --help`

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- `issue update --project <id>` now assigns an issue to a project instead of being parsed but ignored, which previously caused `issue update requires at least one field to update` when `--project` was the only update field
- `issue update` help, docs, and bundled skill text now show the supported `--label <name|id>` option

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `linearctl gql query` (and all curated/generated commands) now surfaces GraphQL error details in human-readable output instead of only showing a generic "HTTP 400" message; field-level validation errors, paths, and extension codes are printed as indented bullet lines below the main error
- Resolution error candidates (e.g., from ambiguous state/team/label names) no longer print `[object Object]`; the formatter now extracts the `display` field with `id` fallback from candidate objects
- GraphQL errors returned with HTTP 200 (partial success) now render their `path` and `extensions.code` in human output; previously these details were silently dropped

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `project update` help text now includes `[--description ...]` (handler already supported it, but agents and humans could not discover the flag from help output)
- Linear API validation errors (e.g., "description must be shorter than or equal to 255 characters") now surface the specific constraint message instead of the generic "Argument Validation Error"

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `project update --target-date <YYYY-MM-DD>` to set or change a project's target date
- `project update --state` now resolves status names (e.g. "Paused", "Active Development") and state types (e.g. "completed", "backlog") to status IDs automatically; UUIDs are passed through directly

### Fixed

- `project update --state` sending a raw state type string instead of resolving to a `statusId`, causing "status not found" errors on every state change
- `project update --target-date` now validates YYYY-MM-DD format and rejects impossible dates (e.g. 2026-02-30) before making the API call
- Project status resolution now paginates the `projectStatuses` connection to fetch all pages instead of only the first 100
- Project status fetch errors now preserve and return the original GraphQL error details instead of a generic message

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `project list` and `project get` JSON output now includes `progress` (float), `health` (enum), `currentProgress`, and a normalized `milestones` array with truncation metadata (`milestonesPageInfo`, `milestonesTruncated`)
- `project get` detail payload includes richer milestone fields: `description`, `sortOrder`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- `project list --state <status-type>` filters by project state type (`backlog`, `planned`, `started`, `paused`, `completed`, `canceled`)

### Fixed

- All project commands (`list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) returning HTTP 400 due to `totalCount` field not existing on `ProjectMilestoneConnection` and `issues` connection requiring a `first` argument
- `project list` exceeding Linear's query complexity limit (12165 vs 10000 ceiling) when fetching milestones; reduced milestone page size from 50 to 10
- `skills install --scope user` ignoring `HOME` env var override because `os.homedir()` caches the native value in Bun

### Removed

- `issueCounts` field from `project get` JSON output (Linear API does not expose issue count on the project connection)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Release refresh for the current `main` branch, including `issue update --cycle` support.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- `issue attach-slack <identifier> --url <slack-url> [--sync] [--title <text>]` — link a Slack thread to an issue with optional bidirectional comment sync
- `project create-with-issues --name <name> --team <id> --issues-json <json>` — atomically create a project and batch-create linked issues
- Completes MCP server parity — all composite operations from `lp-linear-mcp` now have curated CLI equivalents

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Generated API mutations returning HTTP 400 — Payload types now use `success` as default field selection instead of `id`
- Generated API list commands no longer require `--input-json` when all args are optional
- Generated API commands with required scalar args (e.g. `api application info`) correctly require `--input-json`
- `linearctl gql` help text now shows `--var`, `--vars-file`, `--file`, `--stdin` options

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- `--version` / `-V` flag — print the CLI version
- `--estimate <n>` on `issue create`, `issue update`, and `issue bulk-update` — set story points without raw GraphQL
- `--cycle <id>` on `issue bulk-update` — assign cycle in bulk operations

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- `issue search --query <text>` — full-text search across issues using Linear's issueSearch API
- `cycle current [--team <id>]` — get the currently active cycle for a team
- `--quiet` / `-q` flag on all list commands — suppress truncation warnings when piping JSON
- `issue close --state <name>` — specify which completed state to transition to (validated as completed-type)
- `issue create --cycle <id>` and `--project <id>` — set cycle and project on issue creation
- `project list --state <name>` — filter projects by status
- `--created-after`, `--updated-after`, `--completed-after` date filters on `issue list`
- Truncation warning on stderr when list results are silently capped (the silent 50-item cap was the most dangerous agent usability issue)
- `gql` without subcommand now shows usage help with valid examples

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `--everything` renamed to `--all-teams` for clarity (agents read "everything" as "all statuses" when it means "all teams")
- `issue close` now transitions to a completed workflow state (prefers "Done") instead of calling `issueArchive` which silently hid issues without changing their state
- Help text now shows complete flag lists — `issue create` was showing 2 of 9 flags, `issue list` was missing `--label`, `--priority`, `--order-by`
- Skill doc updated with all new commands and complete signatures
- API manifest now bundled via JSON import (works in compiled binaries)
- Schema pull defaults to `~/.config/linear/schema/` in compiled binaries

### Fixed

- Compiled binary couldn't load API manifest (`import.meta.dirname` resolves to `/$bunfs` in Bun)
- `comment list --issue <id>` and `attachment list --issue <id>` failed with GraphQL type error (`String!` → `ID!`)
- Manifest generator produced scalar types for list args (`IssueSortInput` instead of `[IssueSortInput!]`)
- API list commands used `id` as default field selection on connection types (now uses `nodes { id }`)
- `issue close` defaulted to "WontFix" when team had multiple completed states (now prefers "Done", then lowest position)
- Truncation warning suggested `--all` even when `--after` was in use (mutually exclusive)
- `issue close --state` with a UUID showed the raw ID in output (now shows friendly name from API response)
- `issue close --state` accepted non-completed states silently (now validates type)
- `issue close` returned generic error code for not-found issues (now returns exit code 4 / `not-found` category)
- Pre-existing `schema.test.ts` CI failure (case-sensitive assertion)
