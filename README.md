# linearctl

Agent-first CLI for the Linear API. Built to be used by LLM coding agents like Claude Code and Codex, but works just as well for humans at the terminal.

Three command layers: curated commands for common workflows, a generated API layer for full schema coverage, and raw GraphQL as a fallback. Human-readable output is the default; pass `--json` or `--json-envelope` for stable machine-readable contracts that agents can rely on.

## Install

### Linux and macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or install a specific version:

```bash
LINEAR_VERSION=v0.8.13 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

On Debian/Ubuntu, the installer automatically uses the `.deb` package. To skip deb and install the raw binary instead:

```bash
LINEAR_NO_DEB=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

### npm / Node.js

If Node.js 20 or newer is already installed:

```bash
npm install --global @qwrobinson/linearctl
```

This installs the same `linearctl` command without downloading a platform-specific binary. To run it once without a global install:

```bash
npx --yes @qwrobinson/linearctl --version
```

macOS releases use Developer ID signing and notarization. First launch requires
Internet access for Gatekeeper's ticket lookup; the standalone binaries cannot
carry stapled tickets. See [macOS signing](docs/macos-signing.md) for the release
policy and required maintainer secrets.

### Windows

From PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path ([IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "install-linearctl.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer -AddToPath
Remove-Item $installer
```

The installer downloads `linearctl-windows-x64.zip`, requires a matching release checksum, and installs the archived `linearctl.exe` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\linearctl\bin` by default. Pass `-InstallDir C:\path\to\bin` or set `LINEAR_INSTALL_DIR` to choose another directory. Omit `-AddToPath` if you prefer to manage `PATH` yourself.

Or build from source:

```bash
bun run build:binary
cp dist/linearctl ~/.local/bin/linearctl
```

On Windows, `bun run build:binary` produces `dist\linearctl.exe`; copy it to a directory on your user `PATH`.

The compiled binary has no runtime dependencies. Building from source requires the [Bun](https://bun.sh) version pinned in `.bun-version`. See [build and release validation](docs/releasing.md) for toolchain updates, generated-artifact checks, and release gates.
Local macOS builds are not Developer ID signed or notarized. If Bun leaves an
invalid signature (verification fails or execution exits 137), follow the
[local signature verification and repair steps](docs/macos-signing.md#local-builds-and-signature-repair).

## Quick start

Point your agent at the install guide and it will handle everything:

> Install and set up linearctl using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/INSTALL.md

Or do it step by step:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrobins/linearctl/main/install.sh | sh

# Install agent skills
linearctl skills install
```

Then ask your agent:

> Set up linearctl with my Linear API key. My key is in the LINEAR_API_KEY environment variable.

Or set up manually:

### API key

Create an API key at https://linear.app/settings/api, then:

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...
linearctl auth login --profile work --api-key-env LINEAR_API_KEY --set-default
linearctl team list
linearctl team get <team-key> --set-default
```

Your key is now stored in `~/.config/linear/credentials` (permissions `0600`) and loaded automatically on every run. No env vars to export in your shell profile, no secrets in dotfiles. You only need `LINEAR_API_KEY` for that initial login.

On Windows the same file is `%USERPROFILE%\.config\linear\credentials`. linearctl replaces inherited permissions with a protected ACL that grants full control only to the current Windows user, and refuses to load a credentials file whose ACL is broader.

### OAuth (browser-based)

Create an OAuth app at https://linear.app/settings/api/applications and register `http://127.0.0.1:8765/oauth/callback` as its redirect URI, then:

```bash
linearctl auth login --profile work --oauth --oauth-client-id <id> --set-default
```

For unattended services, use the OAuth client-credentials grant. Pass the client secret through an environment variable or piped stdin; it is never written to the profile:

```bash
export LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET=...
linearctl auth login --profile service --oauth-client-credentials \
  --oauth-client-id <id> --oauth-client-secret-env LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET --set-default
```

Use `--oauth-client-secret-stdin` instead of `--oauth-client-secret-env` when the secret is piped. Client-credentials login does not open a browser or start a callback listener.

### Usage

Profile metadata is in `~/.config/linear/config`. See [auth and profiles](docs/auth-and-profiles.md) for the full file layout.

```bash
linearctl issue list
linearctl issue list --state "In Progress"
linearctl issue create --title "Fix pagination bug" --priority 2
linearctl issue get INF-42
linearctl auth whoami
```

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output (see [output modes](docs/output-modes.md)).
For command discovery, agents can inspect the stable curated metadata with `linearctl --metadata curated --json`.

## Profiles

Credentials are stored in AWS CLI-style INI files at `~/.config/linear/`:

```
~/.config/linear/
  config          # default profile, workspace metadata
  credentials     # API keys and OAuth tokens (0600 permissions)
```

Each profile is a named section. Resolution order: `--profile` flag > `LINEAR_PROFILE` env var > configured default. See [auth and profiles](docs/auth-and-profiles.md) for the full file layout and OAuth setup.

## Output modes

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Human-readable (not stable, not for parsing) |
| `--json` | Data-only JSON (stable contract) |
| `--json-envelope` | Envelope with `ok`, `data`, `pageInfo`, `errors`, `meta` |
| `--jsonl` | Streaming, one JSON object per line; requires `--all` or `--max <n>` |
| `--raw` | Exact GraphQL response (gql only) |
