# Install linearctl

linearctl is an agent-first CLI for the Linear API. Follow these steps to install and configure it.

## 1. Install the binary

Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrnet/linearctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

This detects your OS and architecture and installs to `~/.local/bin/linearctl`. On Debian/Ubuntu it uses a `.deb` package automatically.

macOS releases are Developer ID signed and notarized. First launch needs Internet
access so Gatekeeper can retrieve Apple's ticket; standalone binaries cannot be
stapled for offline first launch. The installer does not remove quarantine. See
[macOS signing](docs/macos-signing.md) for details and the separate repair path
for locally built binaries.

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your PATH, add it:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path ([IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) "install-linearctl.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qwrnet/linearctl/main/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer -AddToPath
Remove-Item $installer
```

The PowerShell installer verifies `linearctl-windows-x64.zip`, extracts `linearctl.exe`, and installs it to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\linearctl\bin`. Use `-InstallDir C:\path\to\bin` or `LINEAR_INSTALL_DIR` to override the destination.

If Node.js 20 or newer is already installed, you can install the CLI from npm on any supported platform:

```bash
npm install --global @qwrobinson/linearctl
```

Or run it once without a global install:

```bash
npx --yes @qwrobinson/linearctl --version
```

## 2. Install agent skills

```bash
linearctl skills install
```

This auto-detects installed agents (Claude Code, Codex) and writes the skills to the right directories.

## 3. Set up authentication

Ask the user for their Linear API key. They can create one at https://linear.app/settings/api.

Once you have the key, store it in an environment variable and run:

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY=<their-api-key>
linearctl auth login --profile default --api-key-env LINEAR_API_KEY --set-default
```

In PowerShell, set the variable with `$env:LINEAR_API_KEY = "<their-api-key>"` and run the same `linearctl auth login` command. Windows credentials are protected with a non-inheriting ACL for the current user; Unix credentials retain strict `0600` permissions.

## 4. Set a default team

```bash
linearctl team list
```

Ask the user which team they primarily work in, then:

```bash
linearctl team get <team-key> --set-default
```

## 5. Verify

```bash
linearctl auth whoami
```

This should show the user's name, email, and workspace.

## Done

The CLI is ready. Use the linearctl skill for command routing and examples.
